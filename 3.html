    <h2>MOUNT FUJI</h2>
    <p>It is the tallest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci
      on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth.[1] Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to
      1708.
    </p>

    <h2>LOCATION</h2>
    <p>The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo and is visible from the Japanese capital on clear
      days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is
      commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited
      by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers.</p>

    <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
    <p>November to February: This period is generally considered the best time to visit Mount Fuji for clear views. The
      weather tends to be clearer during these months, increasing your chances of getting unobstructed views of the
      mountain.</p>

    <h2>LOCAL FOOD</h2>
    <p>Mountain huts on Mt. Fuji will only have traditional Japanese food available, such as udon noodles, various rice
      bowl options, miso soup etc. If you have any dietary constraints such as being vegetarian, you will need to pack
      your own lunch for Day 1.</p><br>

    </p>

    <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
    <p>The best time to visit Tokyo is between March and April and September and November. Autumn ushers in colorful
      foliage and comfortable temperatures. Spring brings in much of the same, but instead of vibrant fall hues, the
      foliage you'll see here are cherry blossom trees in full bloom.
      Tokyo has a humid subtropical climate and four distinct seasons. The summer months (June to August) are hot and
      sticky due to an unpleasant level of humidity, while winters (December to February) can get fairly cold.
    </p>

    <h2>LOCAL FOOD</h2>
    <p>The traditional cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is
      an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked
      in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in sushi.
