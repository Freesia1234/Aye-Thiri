  <h2>FOOD NEARBY</h2>
  <p>You're most definitely going to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace when you're in Korea, but what are you going to eat after touring the palace? Today, we're going to be introducing some great gourmet restaurant options in the neighborhood. It's a pretty busy area, so make sure to set aside time for waiting.Okin Pizza is a renovated traditional hanok and a super famous pizza joint right by Gyeongbokgung Palace. The pizzas have unique Korean twists to them; their best dish is the pumpkin cheese pizza. This Korean-Western fusion restaurant is super popular, so expect a wait.

  <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
  <p>The Gyeongbokgung Palace best time to visit is in the morning, when it's quietest and before the changing of the guard happens at 11am. If you have time, try to arrive by 10 am just after the gates open.There are 7,700 rooms at Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul . Even though you cannot enter all of them, it's still a huge place and will take quite some time to explore and really take in. I would say anywhere between 2 and 3 hours seems like a good amount of time to really experience Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul .
