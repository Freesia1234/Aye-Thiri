    <h2>GREAT WALL OF CHINA</h2>
    <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of
      ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.
      Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi
      Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.
    </p>

    <h2>LOCATION</h2>
    <p>The Great Wall stretches across 15 northern Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, from the
      Bohai Sea in the east to the Gobi Desert, 2,500 kilometers away in the west. There are 15 geographically important
      passes built along the route.</p>

    <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
    <p>The wall can be visited all year, but I'd say the best times are late March to May, and September to early
      November. During these months, temperatures are comfortable, rain is less likely and the scenery is at its best.
    </p>

    <h2>BEIJING</h2>
    <p>Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China. With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's
      most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in
      Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16
      urban, suburban, and rural districts.
    </p>

    <h2>LOCATION</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is situated on the Pacific Ocean side of central Honshu, Japan's main island, amidst the Kanto Plain, the
      largest tract of low-lying terrain in the country. To the west and north sides of Tokyo are volcanic mountain
      ranges, including Mount Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan.
    </p>

    <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
    <p>The best times to visit Beijing are from March to May and from September to October. These temperate seasons
      provide the best climate, not to mention colorful scenery. In contrast, summer brings sweltering heat, and winter
      ushers in cold temps and sometimes snow.

    <h2>EMPEROR QINSHINHUANG'S MAUSOLEUM SITE MUSEUM</h2>
    <p>No doubt thousands of statues still remain to be unearthed at this archaeological site, which was not discovered
      until 1974. Qin (d. 210 B.C.), the first unifier of China, is buried, surrounded by the famous terracotta
      warriors, at the centre of a complex designed to mirror the urban plan of the capital, Xianyan. The small figures
      are all different; with their horses, chariots and weapons, they are masterpieces of realism and also of great
      historical interest.</p>

    <h2>LOCATION</h2>
    <p>Located at the northern foot of Lishan Mountain, 35 kilometers northeast of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, Qinshihuang
      Mausoleum is the tomb of Emperor Qinshihuang, founder of the first unified empire in Chinese history during the
      3rd century BCE.
    </p>

    <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
    <p>This is the most famous attraction in Xi'an. You must book tickets early and visit in the morning. It is
      recommended not to go during the summer vacation.
