    <h2>TAIPEI</h2>
    <p>The capital of Taiwan, Taipei is a metropolitan city known for its skyscrapers, shopping streets, night markets
      and contemporary buildings – most notably: the famous Taipei 101, while still being able to preserve its history
      and culture with museums, temples and memorial halls.
    </p>

    <h2>LOCATION</h2>
    <p>Located in Northern Taiwan, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City that sits about 25
      km (16 mi) southwest of the northern port city of Keelung.</p>

    <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
    <p>Taiwan's climate is subtropical, except for the very southern part of the island, which is tropical. Summers are
      long and hot, lasting from April or May to September or October. The winters are short and mild, although snow
      does fall in the mountains and occasionally at lower elevations in the north.</p>

    <h2>SUN MOON LAKE</h2>
    <p>Sun Moon Lake is a lake in Yuchi Township, Nantou County, Taiwan. It is the largest body of water in Taiwan. The
      area around the lake is home to the Thao tribe, one of aboriginal tribes of Taiwan.[1] Sun Moon Lake surrounds a
      tiny island called Lalu.[2] The east side of the lake resembles a sun while the west side resembles a moon, hence
      the name.

    <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
    <p>December is a great month to visit as the weather is nice and there are not many visitors. This is one of the
      most popular places to visit in Taiwan. We took the Nantou Sun Moon Lake bus from Gancheng Bus Station in Taichung
      early in the morning.
    </p>


    <h2>LOCAL FOOD</h2>
    <p>The main street is full of food stalls and souvenir shops. Food specialities include fried mushroom buns, fried
      mochi, tea-braised egg, Assam tea, etc.

    <h2>TAROKO NATIONAL PARK</h2>
    <p>While it's possible to visit Taroko on a day trip, I highly recommend staying longer as there is so much to do
      and see! To really get a feel of what the area offers, stay at least two to three days. This will allow sufficient
      time to do a few hikes and explore some of the stunning places around Hualien.

    <h2>THINGS TO DO IN TAROKO NATIONAL PARK</h2>
    <p>Inle Lake,a freshwater lake located in the Nyaungshwe Township of Shan State, part of Shan Hills in Myanmar
      (Burma).

    </p>

    <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h2>
    <p>Taroko Gorge National Park is open and able to be visited at any time of year. However, it is worth nothing that
      during typhoon season which runs from May to September, certain trails or sections of the park may be closed for
      safety reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>TRADITIONAL FOOD</h2>
    <p>This delicious meal — a traditional dish of the Taroko aborigines in Taiwan's Taroko National Park — features a
      thick fatty pork, a wooden shoot of sticky bamboo rice, chicken soup, fried pork pieces and native vegetables like
      mushrooms, sweet potatoes, radishes and morning glory.
